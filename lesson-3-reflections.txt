    For backup, sharing, collaboration or working from different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

stored locally?

    I can make a diff and understand what a merge may mean. I have a reference to test and compare.
